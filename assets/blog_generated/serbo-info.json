{"text":"<p>Serbo is a server manager written in Rust. This package allows for the creation and configuration of seperate servers that can be individually launched and stopped.</p>\n<p>To manage one or more servers, you must first create a Manager. This struct will allow you to control and manage multiple servers. A manager requires three arguments: A folder to contain the files of the servers you are managing, a version folder, which contains folders containing server files that correspond to the versions of Minecraft that you are supporting (they should be named as such: 1.16.1, 1.15.2 ...), and a jar_name, which is the name of the jarfile that serbo should execute to start the server.</p>\n<p>You call methods on this manager to create, delete, start, stop, change a server's version, and to obtain a reference to a struct that represents an online server called an Instance. With an Instance, you have access to methods that can access stdout (the server output), send a command to the server (via stdin), or stop that specific server.</p>\n","date":"8/20/20","title":"Serbo Info"}
