Getting started with the Van Editor
2/13/21

The Van editor is the tool used to define the layout and structure of rooms using the objects that you define, compiling the project when you've made a change, or building a game to be deployed publically.

Upon first starting the editor, you'll be greeted with this screen.

To create a game, click the "New Project" folder in the top left of the editor. A file prompt will open: create a folder that will contain your game, and select it. The editor will then generate the skeleton for the game, and install the required dependencies. This may take a while, up to a couple minutes; do not close the editor while it is working. Once the log has updated with a completion message, the game is completely set up. At this point, you'll be able to click the button labeled: "Open Project". This button will prompt you to select your game's main.ts file. This file was generated during the previous step, and is located under {game name}/src/game/main.ts. Once you've selected the main.ts file and the game has loaded, you'll see this screen.
